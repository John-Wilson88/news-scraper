# news-scraper
"News Scraper" is a web app the scrapes news articles from The Wall Street Journal and displays them to the user. The user should be able to save an article and add a note to it. This app will be using a MongoDB database, mongoose for creating schemas, express, to create the server, express-handlebars for templating, and cheerio and request for scrapping. 

This assignment is unfinished, i struggle with this one quite a bit. I need to look in to Mongo/Mongoose allot more. I mostly just ran out of time working on this. 

As of now the App will scrape the wall street journal for a few articles, and store them in the db and display them, and the only way as of now you can interact with each article is deleting them. So everything that I have done "works" but i still have quite a bit still todo.

Whats left todo:
	1. giving the scrape button functionality.
	2. allowing the user to add notes.
	3. adding logic so the db doesnt store duplicate articles.
	4. host it on heroku.
